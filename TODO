# Fix parameters --std and --profile
This two arguments:
    parser.add_argument("--std", type=str, default="23", help="C++ standard to use (default: '23')")
    parser.add_argument("--profile", type=str, default=None, help="Conan profile to use")
don't make any sense.
It depends on the template being used the posibility, or obligation, of selecting the C++ standard or the Conan profile.

For example, the "basic" template doesn't use "--std" but use "--profile"... and the profile should be present on developer's machine.
But "basic-devcontainer" uses "--std" and should not use "--profile".

My idea:
Each template should list it's options.
Instead of a "list.txt" file, I should have a "list.json" file that enables to list all the potential parameters needed.
I don't know if that scalates enough. For example, "basic" should check that Conan is actually installed and that it actually has the "--profile" specified.
That requires code, Python code. So a "list.json" maybe is not enough. Maybe a "plugin" system should be used and each template can add python code somehow.
